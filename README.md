## Confidence in decision making across domain and modality: evidence from three studies

Metacognition involves second-order behaviors about first-order ones. It remains unclear whether confidence refers to a set of computations across multiple behaviors or if it is driven by independent factors. Previous studies have focused on correlations across several tasks, yet evidence is mixed and more complex models of domain-generality were not taken into account. We gather 3 studies (N between 253 and 547 participants) run in the context of the EU COST CA18106 to investigate this domain-generality. 
We found a fixed pattern of cross-task correlations for both metacognitive bias and metacognitive efficiency. For the first time, we used confirmatory factor analyses to investigate the existence of general processes. We found evidence for a weak domain-generality with a metacognitive module for perceptual tasks and another for cognitive tasks. We also explored the influence of metacognitive bias on metacognitive efficiency through structural equation modeling.
